# Parallelism
A repository to demonstrate that I have learned and can apply (at least somewhat) the concept of parallelism in my code.

### Description

This Code Uses an API from the CDC that contains information on foodborne and waterborne diseases. There are two primary functions, the first one will run the data, getting the year, month, state, mode of transmission, the name of the disease, where it was caught, and the number of deaths, and then will display the information without using threads. The second function will do the same, except it will use threads, senaphores, and locks to speed up the process.
