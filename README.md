# Parallelism
A repository to demonstrate that I have learned and can apply (at least somewhat) the concept of parallelism in my code.

### Description

This Code Uses an API from the CDC that contains information on foodborne and waterborne diseases. There are two primary functions, the first one will go through the data looking at the year, month, state, mode of transmission, name of the disease that caused the outbreak, environment where patient 0 was infected, and the number of deaths from the outbreak.

### Outcome

For the most part the function that uses threads is faster, I immagine that if I had more data to use it would show more of a difference.

### What I want to work on in the future

I want to add the other points of data to the output of the code.
